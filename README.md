District Ganga Committee (DGC) is responsible for the administration and oversight of the development or
rejuvenation of 149 ponds in Gonda District, Uttar Pradesh, under the Mission Amrit Sarovar initiative. DGC
has appointed Innovators Infratech LLP (IIL) to act as project proponent (PP) for water credits on select Amrit
Sarovars. Launched on 24th April, 2022, under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, this mission aims to conserve water
by developing or rejuvenating multiple Amrit Sarovars across Gonda districts, empowering local farmers with
a dependable water supply that sustains agricultural productivity even in drought-prone regions.

Gonda, an important district in Uttar Pradesh, comprises four tehsils—Gonda, Colonelganj, Tarabganj, and
Mankapur—with a predominantly agrarian economy that relies heavily on monsoon-fed water sources and
groundwater. The district has long faced challenges related to water conservation, seasonal water scarcity,
and groundwater depletion. The restoration of 149 ponds under this initiative plays a crucial role in
enhancing water security, improving irrigation support, and promoting ecological balance in the region.
Before the project, these water bodies lacked proper delineation and structure. Now, they have
been transformed into well-defined and functional water management systems. 

PP has significantly contributed to improving groundwater recharge and water conservation in Gonda
District. These restored ponds function as effective artificial recharge structures, strategically designed to
enhance rainwater harvesting, groundwater replenishment, and overall water retention.
By implementing this initiative, PP has demonstrated how targeted interventions like pond restoration can
effectively address regional water security challenges. The success of these 151 recharge structures
highlights the potential for scaling such solutions across other districts facing similar issues. Through careful
planning, site selection, and technical execution all overseen by PP this model can serve as a blueprint for
achieving broader quantitative targets for groundwater recharge and sustainable water management in
vulnerable regions.
The rejuvenation of villages and 149 ponds in Gonda District, Uttar Pradesh, is a strategic initiative aimed at
enhancing water security and promoting sustainable rural development.

The rejuvenation efforts focus on:

● Rainwater Harvesting and Groundwater Recharge:
The design of these ponds is centred on maximizing the capture and storage of rainwater during
monsoon seasons, ensuring that water remains available throughout the year. With optimized outlet
channels and efficient drainage systems, the ponds are adept at collecting a significant volume of
rainwater. This stored water not only provides an immediate source of water for various uses but
also facilitates groundwater recharge. As water gradually percolates through the pond bed, it
replenishes the underlying aquifers, thereby stabilizing the local water table and mitigating the
impacts of seasonal water scarcity. This dual functionality enhances overall water security for the
community and supports sustainable rural development.

● Enhanced Water Security:
The rejuvenated ponds are designed to capture and store rainwater efficiently, ensuring that a
reliable supply of water is available throughout the year. This is particularly important during the dry
season when natural water sources are scarce. In addition to direct water storage, these ponds play
a crucial role in recharging groundwater. As rainwater percolates through the pond sediments, it
helps to replenish the aquifers, thus maintaining or even increasing the local water table. This dual
benefit of direct storage and groundwater recharge provides a robust defense against water scarcity
in the region.

● Agricultural and Livelihood Support:
The ponds serve as a dedicated source of water for irrigation, which is essential for enhancing agricultural
productivity in an agrarian economy. With a consistent water supply, farmers can plan their cropping
cycles more effectively, leading to improved yields and reduced crop failures during periods of irregular
rainfall. Furthermore, the ponds are multi-purpose in nature; they also provide water for livestock. These
activities diversify rural income sources, offering communities additional avenues for economic stability
and growth beyond traditional farming.

● Economic Upliftment:
Implementation of the pond rejuvenation project generates significant local employment opportunities.
The construction phase, which involves land preparation, excavation, and building of embankments,
creates jobs for local laborers and skilled workers. This not only improves the livelihoods of those directly
employed but also stimulates the local economy through increased spending and the development of
ancillary services. By using locally available materials and sustainable construction practices, the project
minimizes costs and fosters economic self-sufficiency in rural areas.

● Community Empowerment and Ownership:
A key aspect of this initiative is its strong emphasis on community participation. Local community leaders,
Gram Panchayats, and job card holders, are actively involved in every stage of the project; from planning
and construction to ongoing maintenance. This inclusive approach instills a sense of ownership and
responsibility within the community, ensuring that the ponds are well cared for and maintained in the
long term. Additionally, public events and community-driven maintenance programs help to strengthen
social bonds and local pride, further cementing the project's sustainability.

● Environmental and Ecological Benefits:
The pond rejuvenation project also offers significant environmental advantages. By creating a stable
water body, the ponds become habitats for a variety of aquatic flora and fauna, thereby enhancing local
biodiversity. The strategic plantation of trees, such as Neem, Peepal, and Banyan, around the pond
perimeters helps control soil erosion and stabilizes the embankments. These green belts contribute to
better micro-climate regulation by cooling the surrounding areas and mitigating the impact of heat.
Overall, these measures improve the local ecosystem and increase resilience against the adverse effects
of droughts and floods.

● Advanced Monitoring and Sustainability:
To ensure the long-term effectiveness and integrity of the ponds, the project incorporates advanced
monitoring tools such as geo-tagging, mobile app tracking, and remote sensing technologies. These tools
enable real-time monitoring of water levels, structural health, and maintenance needs, ensuring that any
issues are promptly addressed.

Regular audits and technical inspections, carried out by local Panchayat representatives and government
officials, safeguard the ponds' functionality and structural integrity. This proactive approach not only
extends the lifespan of the infrastructure but also reinforces the community’s capacity to manage and
sustain the resource over time.
Each of these implementation benefits contributes to a comprehensive strategy that not only addresses
immediate water scarcity but also lays the foundation for sustainable rural development and enhanced
community resilience.
